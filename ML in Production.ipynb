    "We have spent a lot of time in this course working, as many data scientists do, in our own local development enviroments (our laptops). Within large mature organizations leveraging machine learning, this may be representative of a smaller proportion of the work put into data science development. Most go through the process of first doing exploratory and prototyping work in ML, with the goal of eventually incorporating said models into their service offerings or products. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we are referring to the difference between doing data science _as an activity_ versus _developing it as product._\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no value in building models if the outputs of those models cannot be used. While many companies may apply data science techniques only to develop insights used to inform business decision-making (this being closer to the practice of ordinary data analytics, only with larger data sets and the addition of machine learning) others seek to develop data science infrastructure and systems such that it may be benefit others throughout the organization and be incorporated into other systems and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Companies such as Amazon and Netflix heavily rely upon recommendation for suggesting products and content\n",
    "- Uber uses machine learning to predict arrival times of drivers in near-real time\n",
    "- Facebook leverages computer vision techniques to auto-label and tag photos\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all examples of turning ML in product, where the outputs of machine learning models are incorporated into features within a product and enhance the experience for the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always the case, as sometimes 'productionalization' (the process of putting machine learning into production) may mean only serving up the outputs internally within an organization. For example, a customer scoring model might have its outputs made available to different teams and arms of the organization with no connection to a data science team which developed it, but those outputs might serve a very valuable purpose for marketing and sales to inform their decisions about their targeting and personalization strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the remainder of this lecture we will address the following questions:\n",
    "- What is meant by putting ML \"into production\"?\n",
    "- How do we make the outputs of our models available for others to consume?\n",
    "- How does machine learning fit into the broader [software development lifecycle (SDLC)](https://hackernoon.com/software-development-lifecycle-sdlc-a-simple-explanation-78d77c466355)?"

    "### What is meant by Production?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand what is meant by \"ML in prod\" we must take a step back and how organizations build software and systems thereof. In this context, an environment (technically, a _deployment environment_, deployment referring to a bundled package of software) refers to a system where software runs. This may refer to a number of servers and other associated systems collectively, or may also refer to a single server or collection of servers in a cluster, often in a more colloquial sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Development Environment** (or \"dev\") is the lowest environment and where new software or new features of existing software are developed. Development environments may vary significantly in terms of the quality of data and processes compared with the other environments. They serve as \"sandbox\" infrastructure for doing development work and unit testing the software as it is created. As such, it is usually acceptable for systems and processes to fail within the development environment, and the permissions are typically much more open within a dev environment and user base larger than other environments as there is little risk of \"breaking anything.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Testing Environment** (or \"test\") is the next environment above development. Code which has passed unit tests is moved into this environment where more extensive testing takes place (_e.g._ functional, integration, and performance testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Staging Environment** (or \"stage\") is the final environment between initial development work and production. This environment should be as close to production as possible, as code is tested here before being finally deployed into prod. As such, it typically has more restrictions on its user base and permissions. Final testing is done in the staging environment before code is considered to be \"production-ready\": user acceptance testing (UAT) and other forms of _production acceptance testing_ or PAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Production Environment** (or \"prod\") are the systems running the software with which users and other systems interact. What is live in production is the gold standard and is the \"known good\" codebase. Testing is not done in prod and if bugs arise, they are fixed in one of the lower environments before being patched in the production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![envs_code_promo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nDR5Uqu8zp-q0iQZESpxNztDPKFLAW6o)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving code up through the environments as it is successively tested and approved is referred to as the _code promotion_ process - or you would say code is being promoted from one environment to the next highest one, or deployed in a given environment. In organizations with mature software development infrastructure and processes in place, these tasks may also be automated to varying degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it should be noted that this four environment setup, while typical, is not universal; differing configurations consisting of greater or fewer environments can and do exist. For example, there may also be dedicated environments for user acceptance (UAT) and production acceptance testing (PAT) separate from test or stage, or conversely, testing and staging code may be done in a single intermediary environment between dev and prod."

    "This mirrors the steps one would follow when putting a model into a \"real\" production environment, where, after the infrastructure is built, model prototypes are often built offline and then gradually promoted until live, or are handed over to a team of machine learning engineers to do the same. Note that even here, there is nothing stopping us from taking our simple code and saved pipeline off our local machine and transferring to a cloud provider such as AWS, in which case with the correct permissions on an EC2 instance we could make our model API open to anyone with a an internet connection (!) A more sophisticated ML API would also have other parameters it could retain, such as metadata on different models available, model versioning, and even URLs to retrain models based upon a specified dataset!\n",

    "- **Development:** Building a prototype or initial model to be put into production. This includes identifying both the required data and output(s), as well as acquiring the necessary data and training a prototype model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation:** Includes testing (unit tests, functional testing, performance testing, etc.) as well as expected performance and behavior from a model standpoint given particular unseen data as input. This is not only done prior to productionizing a model, but additionally may also be performed on a continual basis in automated way after it has been deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment:** Requires identifying dependencies required for a model, and packaging these with it in such a way that they can easily be moved to a production environment for the model to run. For most organizations, this now almost certainly will involve leveraging a [container framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)). Pipelines may also need to be developed to make the necessary data inputs available in the production environment. Finally, \"soft launching\" and/or experimentation via A/B testing are integral to taking a new model live while mitigating possible unforeseen negative impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage and Versioning:** Models need to be stored in a centralized location, as well as use a standard format or formats for ease and consistency in deployment and operation. A version control system for different deployed models should be in place for auditing and governance purposes, as well as the ability to \"roll back\" changes should this be required. A model management system of this kind also facilitates greater collaboration and efficiencies for development and operations teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serving and Integration**: The outputs of the model must be made available, either within the organization, externally through integrations (*e.g.* in a user-facing app or web page), or both, depending upon the model's purpose. This may include APIs for internal use within an organization which allow other developers or business users to make requests while being unaware of the model's internal workings (as we've seen in this lab).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Observability**: Once a model is deployed, it must be available for monitoring in order to continually assess performance, as well as have the necessary code and infrastructure in place to diagnose the root cause of incidents should there be failures or unexpected behaviors - for example, being able to ascertain what data is being used to make individual predictions or confirm dependencies on other systems. Model performance should be monitored in real-time or near real-time to assess performance on a continual basis, and be tied back to organizational KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retraining**: Model performance may deteriorate over time due to [concept drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift) and other factors (*e.g.* qualitative changes in data or other dependent systems) and necessitate retraining and deploying new models. The cadence required for this is informed by performance monitoring as above. Retraining can implemented as part of the MLOps infrastructure, and done in an automated or \"online\" manner with varying levels of complexity and sophistication depending on need and the technical maturity of the organization."
